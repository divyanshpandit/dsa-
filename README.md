This repository contains a simple implementation of a Singly Linked List (SLL) in Python. A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next one, forming a chain. The list supports basic operations like insertion at the beginning, at the end, or after a specific node, as well as iteration.

Features
Insertion at the Beginning: Add an element to the start of the list.
Insertion at the End: Add an element to the end of the list.
Insertion After a Node: Insert an element after a specified node.
Iteration: Iterate through the list using Python's iterator protocol.
Stop Iteration: Automatically stop iteration when the end of the list is reached.
